There's no way for an app to keep a perpetually scheduled prefetch job with a deadline. Prefetch jobs with a deadline will run and apps under this restriction won't be able to schedule new prefetch jobs with a deadline. If a job is rescheduled (by providing {@code true} via {@link JobService#jobFinished(JobParameters, boolean)} or {@link JobService#onStopJob(JobParameters)}'s return value),the deadline is dropped.
